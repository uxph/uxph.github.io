        "In this research, we will do a mixed-method study to understand the UX landscape in the Philippines. First, we deploy the <strong> State of UX in the Philippines Survey </strong> following industry-standards through stratified sampling. Second, we will conduct <strong>remote Focus Groups </strong> to draw  qualitative insights about Filipino UX'ers experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. Lastly, we will scrape online data from a decade, perform analysis, and draw out extra insights at a historical perspective while applying a data-driven approach to understand trends at the local context. Target release of the report is on January 2021.",
        "If you are a student, <b>UX Practitioner</b> or is from HR hiring for UX roles, with your help (by participating in the survey) we can begin to understand the current state of the UX practice in the Philippines and provide valuable insights for improvement in the local context. Your answers will be kept anonymous and strictly confidential, this includes socio-demographic details and information about your company or organization will not be published in any capacity."

These reports are open, free and available for everyone who wish to use them. The 3T is composed of subject matter experts (SMEs) in their field that contribute to useful insights in the research process.",
