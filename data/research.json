There have been many reports that attempt to understand its current state and imagine future trends. However, have been mostly done on a global or regional context.",

        "In this research, we will do a mixed-method study to understand the UX landscape in the Philippines. First, we deploy the <strong> State of UX in the Philippines Survey </strong> following industry-standards through stratified sampling. Second, we will conduct <strong>remote Focus Groups </strong> to draw  qualitative insights about Filipino UX'ers experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. Lastly, we will scrape online data from a decade, perform analysis, and draw out extra insights at a historical perspective while applying a data-driven approach to understand trends at the local context. Target release of the report is on January 2021.",
        "If you are a student, <b>UX Practitioner</b> or is from HR hiring for UX roles, with your help (by participating in the survey) we can begin to understand the current state of the UX practice in the Philippines and provide valuable insights for improvement in the local context. Your answers will be kept anonymous and strictly confidential, this includes socio-demographic details and information about your company or organization will not be published in any capacity."

      "Welcome to the UXPH Research team page! It conducts studies to further understand and analyze the User Experience (UX) landscape in the Philippines. Our team‚Äôs goal is to share reports that describe the UX industry and how it is adopted across various sectors in the country. We regularly explore and publish reports that serve as a reference point for practitioners and companies towards a more data-driven understanding of their work.",
      "The UXPH research team is composed of two main subgroups namely the <b>3T</b> (Think Tank Team) and the RSA (Research Support Arm).",
      "The <b>3T</b> drives the main research activities of the research team. They are responsible for executing the research mission-vision of UXPH, determining research questions, designing experiments, developing instruments, collecting and analysing data and releasing reports and data-driven policies and recommendations for broader dissemination. These reports are open, free and available for everyone who wish to use them. The 3T is composed of subject matter experts (SMEs) in their field that contribute to useful insights in the research process.",
      "The <b>RSA</b> enables the main research activities held by the 3T. It is composed of a team of visual storytellers, data encoders and enthusiastic volunteers who contribute in the collection of data and preparation of reports by the research team. The RSA serves as an early starting point for volunteers interested in pursuing research as it equips them with meaningful experience to learn the ropes of industry research.",
      "In 2021, we have published and released the first ever State of UX in the Philippines (aka SOUP) report. In the next years, we wish to uncover on specific pain points in the industry such as career transitioning, salaries and hopefully even design systems."
