		<br/>

		<h2 class="whitest">Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			User Experience Philippines (also known as UXPH) is a Philippine design community of individuals passionate about the realm of User Experience (UX), and all things related. In line with community-building activities for the country, UXPH takes part in uplifting and holding standards for the community and its members, its conferences, and its events.
		</p>

		<br/><br/>

		<h2 class="whitest">Harassment, Discrimination, and Offenses</h2>
		<p>
			Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to SOGIE (Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression), age, different ability and/or disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, cultural beliefs, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
		</p>
		<p>
			Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
		</p>
		<p>
			If anyone engages in harassing behavior, the conference organisers and/or volunteers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified as they'll be wearing branded clothing and/or badges.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
		</p>
		<p>
			We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events. <a href="#1"><sup class="blue">[1]</sup></a>

		<br/><br/>

		<h2 class="whitest">Privacy</h2>

Please contact us at <span class="blue">info@uxph.org</span> if you have any specific concerns with Privacy and the data we collect for events.

		<h2 class="whitest">Participants, Refunds, and No-Shows</h2>
