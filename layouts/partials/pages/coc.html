        <h2>Our commitment to our community</h2>
        <p>
            UXPH's aim in hosting events is to offer a positive a safe environment within the community. Just like we believe that more diverse teams build better products, we know that diverse representation at events ultimately creates a stronger community. To that end, our goal is to create an environment where everyone feels welcome to participate, speak up, ask questions, and engage in conversation. We invite all those who participate in this event to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

        <h3>Event venues and facilities</h3>
        <p>
            UXPH events are sponsored by our industry and community partners who have given us the privilege to use their space and facilities . All participants of UXPH events are expected to stay within the designated areas of the event and not enter any other areas unless they have been identified as part of the event.
        </p>
        <p>
            Everyone is expected to be respectful of the surrounding environment, facilities, equipment, and a CLAYGO (clean-as-you-go) Policy is always observed. UXPH will not be held responsible for any damage to property incurred due to negligence and misuse of assets and equipment during our events. Any incident of this nature will be dealt with accordingly by the venue host.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <h3>Consequences of unacceptable behavior</h3>
        <p>
            Unacceptable behavior from any UXPH community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a UXPH community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
        </p>

        <h2>Ticket Refunds, Transfers, and No-Shows</h2>
        <p>
            All activities and events organized by the UXPH Community are carefully planned and well thought of, as every cent that goes to the funding of our activities and events as a non-profit organization are very important.

        </p>

        <p>
            Attendance to all UXPH activities and events are tracked and require an RSVP from attendees unless otherwise stated or explicitly invited. Currently, UXPH uses Eventbrite.com for event ticketing and tracking purposes. 
        </p>

        <p>
            UXPH does not tolerate any form of gatecrashing to our activities and events. We reserve the right to deny entry to anyone who had previously been found violating this Code of Conduct or had failed to RSVP to any of our activities or event. This is done to ensure that all those who RSVPd will be accommodated. Registrants who fail to attend without canceling his/her RSVP can be barred from signing-up for our future activities and events.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you seem incapable of attending the event and have a slot reserved, please vacate the seat as soon as possible so another attendee may avail of it or please contact us immediately at info@uxph.org.
