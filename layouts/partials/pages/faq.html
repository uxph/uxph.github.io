        <li>Will you provide certificates?</li> <br>
        <p>Yes! We have an awesome certificate to give to each attendee at the event. To avail
            of it, youâ€™ll need to fill up a feedback form at the event before we present you

        <p>Tickets are available online via Eventbrite using PayPal. Prices vary according per 
            event and are announced online. A voucher will be sent to your email - please

        </p>

        <li>Do you have student pricing?</li> <br>
        <p>Currently, we do not have student pricing, as our tickets are already reasonably

        <li>Are there walk-in tickets?</li> <br>
        <p>For Cebu, we cannot accept any more walk-ins for the event since all tickets are sold
