      <p>
        The UX landscape in the Philippines is still in its nascent stages, but the need is growing more apparent and comprehensive each year. Since more than a decade ago, technological innovations and cultural paradigms have called for a deeper understanding and implementation of UX practices globally. There have been many reports that attempt to understand its current state and imagine future trends. However, have been mostly done on a global or regional context.

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          How does the Philippines' culturally-diverse environment nurture a specific breed of designers, researchers, and leaders? 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      In this mixed-method study to understand the UX landscape in the Philippines, we are first conducting the <b>State of UX in the Philippines Survey</b> that follow industry standards through stratified sampling. <br/><br/>
      Second, we will conduct <b>in-depth interviews</b> to draw qualitative insights about Filipino UX practitioners' experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. <br/><br/>
      Lastly, we will scrape online data from over a decade to analyze and draw out extra insights at a historical perspective while applying a data-driven approach to understand trends at the local context. <br/><br/>
      The targeted release of the report is in <b> January 2021 </b>.

          We hope the output of this research will reveal interesting insights that can help guide various stakeholders in crafting the local UX professional roadmap for the next decade.
