      <p>
      The UX landscape in the Philippines is getting broader each year. The earliest UX'ers in the country began their march almost a decade ago. Since then, technological innovations and cultural paradigms both globally and locally, have called for a deeper understanding of the UX practice. In recent years, we have seen reports that attempt to understand its current state and imagine future trends. These reports, however, have been mostly done on a global or regional context.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          How does the Philippines' culturally-diverse environment nurture a specific breed of designers, researchers, and leaders? 
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
      In this research, we will do a mixed-method study to understand the UX landscape in the Philippines. First, we deploy the <b>State of UX in the Philippines Survey</b> following industry-standards through stratified sampling. Second, we will conduct <b> remote Focus Groups</b> to draw  qualitative insights about Filipino UX'ers experiences, attitudes, and beliefs. Lastly, we will scrape online data from a decade, perform analysis, and draw out extra insights at a historical perspective while applying a data-driven approach to understand trends at the local context. Target release of the report is on January 2021.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          We hope the output of this research will reveal interesting insights that can help guide various stakeholders in crafting the local UX professional roadmap for the next decade.
