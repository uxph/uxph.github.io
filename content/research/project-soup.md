      <p class="margin-bottom-32">
        The UX landscape in the Philippines is broadening its scope each year. The earliest UXâ€™ers in our country began their march almost a decade ago. Since then, technological innovations and cultural paradigms both globally and locally, have called for a deeper understanding of the UX practice.
        <br/><br/>
        In this report, we aim to capture a holistic picture of the growing UX practice in the Philippines, reveal insightful data, and share a compendium of handy information about the UX design practice in the Philippines. An example of this is the growing and evolving field of UX, the journey of UX practitioners in the Philippines, and a common understanding of what UX is as well as how it is further defined in our country.
