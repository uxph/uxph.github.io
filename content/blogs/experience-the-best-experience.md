Last week, User Experience Philippines (UXPH) held its first ever National Roadshow across the Philippines, starting in Cebu. It was held on August 31, 2019 at The Company, located at the 15th floor of HM Tower in IT Park, Cebu.

UXPH partnered with CebUXD, the local design community in Cebu comprised of User Experience (UX) practitioners, software developers, graphic designers, project managers, and students shared under the philosophy of user-centered design and design thinking. They helped connect the Cebuanos who wanted to learn more about different UX topics and participate in workshops facilitated by different professionals.

## All about UX design deliverables

The day started with a talk from Mica Diaz de Rivera, Head of Operations at Make Technology Inc. on demystifying UX design deliverables. He shared that, according to a study from [Nielsen Norman Group](http://nngroup.com) (NNGroup), the top 3 UX deliverables are prototypes, usability reports, and customer journey maps. He then connected these three deliverables with the 3 workshops that would happen in the afternoon session of the roadshow.

Fish gave tips on how to plan for a minimum viable design team in companies and organizations, where one should consider the UX maturity within the organization, what the demands of the projects are, any skill gaps that need to be addressed, and the maturity of the UX community as well. She also reminded everyone that these should eventually scale depending on the growth of the team and the company.

## Design and team culture in the context of behavioral science

Our last speaker, Dae Lee, Culture Designer at Four Wall Global, ends the morning session by sharing his knowledge on behavioral science and how context is very important when doing things to influence or change the design and team culture within your company.

Dae shared how motivation, ability, and triggers can change or influence behavior, and related these to different UX methods that are being used by many designers today.

He also reminds everyone that they shouldn’t try to change people, and instead know and understand the context behind them and form the environment where they’ll be the ones to choose to change for themselves.
